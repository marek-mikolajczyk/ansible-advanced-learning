ansible.cfg

# enable inventory plugins 
- [inventory]/enable_plugins
- ansible tries plugins according to order
- host_list, script, ini, yaml

# ansible.cfg in world readable dir 
- export ANSIBLE_CONFIG

# inventory yaml format
- group has: children, hosts, vars
- all is not required at the beginning

# dirs for host_vars, group_vars
- ini to yaml conversion - displays wrongly host vars after export. it works, but it's
  better to have dirs for host and group vars. otherwise, requires manual checko
- but ansible_connection or ansible_user easier to keep in inventory
- vars stay, even if host has groupvar from group2, and playbook calls group2

# to convert: 
# converting to yaml and keeping vars works better when inventory has group_vars/ and host_vars/
ansible-inventory -i simple.ini  --list --yaml--output <target file>.yml

#yaml syntax for inventory 
- uses : as start of block - be careful for unquoted
  but not:a:problem is okay
  '' is okay, "" permits \n
  so use "" when using [] {} > | * & ! % # ` @
 
# inventory vars
- inventory/host_vars (directory)/firewall.yml
- if inventory /etc/ansible/hosts, then /etc/ansible/group_vars 
- ansible_host is real dns/ip

inventory_hostname - currently processes host
ansible_host - dns or ip used to connect
ansible_facts['hostname'] or ['fqdn'] collected from fact
ansible_play_hosts - all not yet failed and will be used for next tasks
ansible_play_hosts_all - all targeted for play
ansible_connection - ssh, local for localhost
