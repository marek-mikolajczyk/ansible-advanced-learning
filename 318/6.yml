logical networks - datacenter, need vlan
2 types: 
- vm network
- infra network. 

1 linux bridge per logical network
bridge connects virtual and physical network

infra networks don't have linux bridge. at cluster level


networks are required - must connect on every host in cluster, always operational

created in datacenter, assigned by clusters

add networks to hosts from host menu
labels fro auto adding (on host and on vlan)

more that one network on host's nic - vlan tag required




[root@host ~]# yum update
[root@host ~]# yum install vdsm-hook-openstacknet
