1. to connect to ipa - ovirt-aaa-...extension..., because its and extension
then restart ovirt-engine!!!!

change cluster = remove host
wait for correct msg in events

adding host takes time!!!!

rpm2cpio oneliner!!!!


networks extra providers - use hooks
[root@host ~]# yum update
[root@host ~]# yum install vdsm-hook-openstacknet
[root@host ~]# iptables -D INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

create dc - create cluster - have a host in correct dc,cluster > create network in cluster
