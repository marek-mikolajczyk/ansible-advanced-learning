qemu agent for windows iso is in rhv manager repo

- new vm
- clone (sealed!)
- template

vm > resource > memory baloon

kickstart takes time

install and enable qemu-guest-agent

host pinning - host
ha

clone vm - separate or dependant (overlay)

numa - non-uniform memory access . pins to physical numa nodes
means big vm that cannot fit in single host socket can be spreat across numa nodes


with templates, ksm (kernel samepage memory) works 
sealing - remove host keys, mac address
virt-sysprep on linux powered off (sealing in rhv)
sysprep.exe on windows powered off
base vm to make templates - seal in then never start again

template takes time 


cloud init starts during boot and looks for instructions
add to initial run of new template, edit template
add to initial run in 'run once'

host name, time zone, authentication and network properties, and for running customer cloud-init scripts.

template inherits init run
template edit

cloud init uses yaml, but it's not ansible


some changes of cloud init are persistend, even if used with run once (hostname, timezone, users with passwords, custom scripts)
network settings are not persistent (write_files) override this


yum install -y cloud-init && systemctl poweroff
